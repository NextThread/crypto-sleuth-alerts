            <p>
              ChartPulse was founded with a clear mission: to democratize access to professional-grade crypto market analysis tools. 
              We believe that every trader, regardless of experience level or portfolio size, deserves access to powerful analytical 
              resources that were once available only to institutional investors.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="mb-3">
              ChartPulse began in 2025 when a group of crypto traders, data scientists, and software engineers came together with a 
              shared frustration: existing market analysis tools either lacked depth, were prohibitively expensive, or too complex 
              for the average trader to use effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              After months of development and testing with a community of dedicated beta users, ChartPulse was born â€“ combining 
              sophisticated technical analysis with an intuitive interface that both novice and experienced traders can benefit from.
